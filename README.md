Vikingard Codes and Cheats for 5000k free gold Hacks tutorial iOS Android - As we mentioned earlier, the wisest way is to take only one spear and your underwear to the farm. So you won't lose anything of value (by value, we mean hard to get weapons and armor). Therefore, if you are looking for maple logs or copper mines in the red zone, you'd better not wear fancy equipment and turn yourself into a target, which will only kill yourself. After all, nothing disgusts the Vikings more than seeing his prey with nothing but building materials and piles of dogwood. Another thing that upgrading your area does for you is to increase your chances of finding rare items in the wild. Whether it's equipment or materials, the higher the level of your area, you'll find more items you usually can only find in tombs. Work towards a better region as much as possible and put all other goals in a secondary position. Eventually, you will be able to create the most coveted workstation, Vikingard cheat codes.
